				<span>Jio and Disney+ Hotstar are reportedly teaming up to offer free IPL 2020 live streaming for select prepaid plan users and select Jio Fiber broadband plan users in India. The telecom operator is expected to offer free streaming to Rs. 401 and Rs. 2,599 prepaid plan subscribers. Both these plans already offer Disney+ Hotstar subscription but details regarding access to IPL 2020 live streaming were not certain till now. Jio Fiber subscribers on plans priced at Rs. 849 and above are reported to receive the same benefit as well, given that these plans already offer complimentary Disney+ Hotstar VIP annual subscription.</span>

				<span>The Jio deal seems especially important as Disney+ Hotstar seems to be planning to restrict IPL 2020 streaming to Premium tiers subscribers this year, as per an online report. So despite being subscribers to just Disney+ Hotstar VIP plan, the Jio users with Rs. 401 and Rs. 2,599 plan will get to see IPL 2020 live. Same is the case with Jio Fiber users. When asked about IPL 2020 availability on Disney+ Hotstar VIP plan, the streaming service said it had nothing to share at the moment. </span>
